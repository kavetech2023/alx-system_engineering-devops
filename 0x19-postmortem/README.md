<h1>Postmortem: Login and Signup Outage - February 28th, 2024</h1>


<h2>Issue Summary</h2>

An outage occurred on our platform affecting user login and signup functionalities. The outage began at 2:00 PM PST on February 28th, 2024, and was fully resolved by 4:30 PM PST, impacting all users attempting to log in or sign up for new accounts. Users encountered error messages and were unable to access the platform.

<h2>Timeline:</h2>

2:00 PM PST: Monitoring alerts triggered for a significant surge in error rates on the user authentication service.
2:05 PM PST: The operations team initiated an investigation, focusing on the login and signup functionalities.
2:15 PM PST: Initial assumption was a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack due to the sudden increase in traffic. Security protocols were escalated.
2:45 PM PST: After reviewing logs and analyzing traffic patterns, a DDoS attack was ruled out. The investigation shifted towards the user authentication service itself.
3:00 PM PST: The issue was escalated to the development team after logs revealed errors in the user verification process.
3:30 PM PST: The root cause was identified as a bug in the code responsible for validating user credentials. This bug caused the service to overload under increased login attempts.
4:00 PM PST: The development team implemented a hotfix by disabling the faulty validation step temporarily while a permanent fix was developed.
4:15 PM PST: The hotfix was deployed, and the user authentication service recovered. Login and signup functionalities resumed for users.
4:30 PM PST: Post-incident monitoring confirmed system stability and the permanent fix was implemented to address the validation bug.

<h2>Root Cause and Resolution:</h2>

The root cause of the outage was a bug in the user authentication service. The bug resided in the code responsible for validating user credentials during login and signup attempts. Under unexpected high volumes of user activity, the faulty code overloaded the service, leading to errors and preventing users from completing the authentication process.

The development team resolved the issue with a two-pronged approach. First, they implemented a hotfix to disable the temporary validation step, restoring login and signup functionality. Second, they developed and deployed a permanent fix to address the underlying code bug within the user authentication service.

<h2>Corrective and Preventative Measures:</h2>

Code Review and Testing: Implement stricter code review processes to identify and rectify potential bugs before deployment. Integrate automated unit testing for the user authentication service to ensure proper functionality under various load conditions.
Performance Optimization: Conduct a performance review of the user authentication service to identify and address any bottlenecks that could be exacerbated by high traffic volumes.

Scalability Planning: Evaluate the scalability of the user authentication service to handle unexpected surges in login and signup attempts. Explore implementing auto-scaling solutions to adjust resources dynamically based on real-time traffic demands.
Incident Response Protocols: Review and refine incident response protocols to ensure efficient communication and collaboration between teams during outages. Establish clear escalation procedures and roles for faster issue identification and resolution.
This postmortem outlines the root cause, resolution, and preventative measures to be taken to prevent similar login and signup outages in the future. By implementing these actions, we aim to create a more robust and reliable user authentication system for our platform.
